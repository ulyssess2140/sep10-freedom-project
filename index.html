 <center><h1>Overview</h1></center>
 <p>Criminal Law is the basic building block to a safe world where criminals are put into the punishments they deserve for doing wrong to society. Lawyers do the job of either representing, or prosecuting defendents who are suspected or accused of committing a crime.
But at times it becomes stressful for a lawyer to keep all the information of the case at ready to make their statement to the jury. First we need to understand the basics of a criminal lawyer(prosecutor):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Prosecutors are elected officials who are responsible for investigating, charging, and prosecuting those suspected of breaking the law. They hold the most responsibility and the most power who represent the people of the US government and backed by the power of the state.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are multiple types of prosecutors that can represent different people/places. Some are U.S attorneys, District attourneys, State attorneys, Appeals prosecutors, County attorney, and Independent counsels, each as important as the other
  </li>
  <li>
    Educational requirements meet the top line, A Bachelor's Degree, LSAT (Law School Admissions Test), needs to enter Law School, and take a Bar exam. That is a lot to take in order to become a criminal prosecutor 
  </li>

<div class="container-sm">
<section id="section-right">Sometimes during a legal battle in court, whether it be the prosecution or the defense giving a testimony, sometimes the evidence spoken can’t be heard within the court. Even when everyone can hear people might forget half of what was said due to the possibility of too much evidence being given. An invention to possibly fix this problem for the jury would be to build a small-medium sized tablet to place in front of the jury stand which will then display a holographic representation of evidence while the prosecution or defense are stating their claims. In this sense it’ll be easier for the jury to follow along and see holographic recreations of a crime scene and see pieces of evidence more clearly.</section>
